# Academic Background
My academic background stems from the combined effort of the education system of 3 countries. If I go by the tree analogy, I found my roots in Bangladesh (my home where I completed my schooling), my trunk in India (my undergraduate in engineering) and am branching out to grow the leaves and fruits now in USA (my graduate studies). I cherish all my experiences and all the people I have met at different places throughout this small journey.

I am currently a 2nd year Graduate Student at Auburn University in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering where I am 
also working as a Graduate Research Assistant. On par with my research, I have also developed modules in the field of Logic Locking of
circuits and Boolean Satisfiability(SAT) attacks. Prior to Auburn, I completed my undergraduate (2022) in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Rourkela, India. 

# Work Experiences

In between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked as a Junior Software Developer at Satisfic for a year. During my undergraduate, I had the opportunity to pursue some internships during the end of my second and third year (Covid and work from home meant a lot of all nighters) which ranged from a front-end designer and developer to Business Analyst. I do believe undergraduate is the best time to explore different interests as the opportunity to do so dwindles down further down the academic journey. I am quite grateful that I got to experience this during my undergraduate studies.
